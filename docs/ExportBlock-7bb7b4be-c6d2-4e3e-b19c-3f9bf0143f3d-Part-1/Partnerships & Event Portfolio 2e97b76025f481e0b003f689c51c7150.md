- Storytelling and marketing

I specialize in building networks and high-value partnerships that power community-driven events. My background involves aligning diverse stakeholders to deliver memorable experiences that drive genuine impact and community growth in the Ethereum space. I build the partnerships, secure the capital, and curate the programming that turns temporary gatherings into lasting local infrastructure.

## Event Showcases

---

Events are catalysts for building robust communities - opening doors to new collaborations, and fostering the growth of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This portfolio showcases a few of the events I have personally helped bring to life over the past 4 years - some of which directly funded local community spaces, and offered containers for deeper problem solving, onboarding new talent, and running hands-on experiments with web3 partners.

### [Regen Village](https://regenvillage.webflow.io/) @EthCC Brussels

*Regens Unite* / *2024*

5 days | 600+ users in token economy

A collaborative experience at the intersection of Web3 and local community. Designed a sponsorship model that went beyond logo placement - by aligning corporate partners with local impact goals, we directed event surplus to seed-fund the Commons Hub (€25k), proving that events can be regenerative financial engines. 

The event served as a dedicated hub for builders and locals alike, bridging the gap between global blockchain innovation and community impact via daily programs, pop-up activations, & an experimental “economy.”

- 25 partners managed
- 7823 $RegenBxl issued
- 60k€ raised in sponsorships

### [Regens Unite Berlin](https://www.regensunite.earth/berlin2022) @ETHBerlin

*Regens Unite / 2022 & 2023*

2 days | 200 participants

A successful experiment in rapid community mobilization and regenerative funding. Raised €16k in sponsorship capital in just 3 weeks to launch this grassroots inaugural event in 2022, directly funding a well-known local co-living/co-working infrastructure (Moos Space) rather than extracting value. Launched during Berlin Blockchain Week and purposely curated for a 50% non-web3 crowd to bridge new connections between diverse builders. Repeated 2 years in a row.

- 50+ interactive workshops, talks and panels
- Secured 10 partners in 3 weeks
- Event organized in 4 weeks, 16k€ raised
- 6k€ directly funded to permanent community hub (Moos Space)
