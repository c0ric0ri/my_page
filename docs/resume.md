THE TL;DR ON ME
I build bridges between capital and community. After spending 10 years closing 6-figure deals and scaling teams in both the corporate & startup worlds, I pivoted fully into Web3 to build things I believe in. Since 2022, I’ve been in the trenches - co-founding Regens Unite, organizing hackathons, and helping DAOs grow. Now I’m looking for a role where I can leverage my experience to make a big impact in Ethereum’s development, and focus all my energy on driving growth for a brand and mission I align with. For me that’s definitely ETHGlobal.
