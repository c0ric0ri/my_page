Build a personal website that has these three pages:
1 - home/landing which is about me, my work and my portfolio as a founder, storyteller, partnerships and sales professional
2 - blog with a simple `WYSIWYG` interface that allows me to easily create new posts with one button, customize font sizes and publish intuitively. The page should include 2 features blog posts at the top and include categorization of posts by topic. 
3 - contact page that includes space for a personal photo, email, social links for X and LinkedIn, and a contact form

## Style

Clean, minimal, using modern text like TT norms
Color palette - natural earth tones (greens, browns, beiges, whites) but in a way that aligns with the tech space in a modern and elegant way
Typography - use a serif font for headings and a sans-serif font for body text
Use paralex scroll effects for the home page

## Instructions:

- use my notion connector to read the page `Partnerships & Event Portfolio` to get additional context on the projects I've been involved with
- use my attached CV file to get context on my background and experience and contact information
- think and build like a professional web designer and branding expert who understands clean design and layout, and strategy around personal portfolio pages and sales pages
- build a simple, self-hosted independent backend. consider that it will be used by someone who does not have experience as a developer, so it needs to run smoothly and be simple to use for making adjustments
- include a toggle button for light and dark mode
- use latest next.js as a feature-driven mono repo architecture
- use shadcn ui for components
- optimize for performance and seo
- the design must be responsive and work on all devices with smooth, elegant animations and transitions
- on the smallest screens keep the UI clean and not cramped
- organize professional journey into a visual, interactive timeline
